# Vulnserver
Set of exploits for vulnserver (https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver/)

Not every exploit is pretty, not every is generic enough (e.g. GTER had very little buffer available, and I thought that it will be nice to write custom shellcode and fit it in the buffer, although with hardcoded addresses), not every is optimal, but all are working and are giving reverse shell to 192.168.0.151:4444.
